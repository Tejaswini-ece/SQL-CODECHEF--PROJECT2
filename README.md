# SQL-CODECHEF--PROJECT2
# 🎓 School Database Project

This project was developed as part of the CodeChef Learn SQL Path. It simulates a school management system using SQL with multiple tasks including table creation, data insertion, query execution, data modification, and salary analysis.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **TASK1_Create_Tables.sql**: SQL script to create tables: Students, Faculty, Courses, Enrollments.
- **TASK2_Insert_And_Retrieve.sql**: SQL script to insert sample data and retrieve specific records.
- *(More tasks can be added similarly)*

## 🧱 Database Tables

- **Students**: Stores student details with constraints on uniqueness for roll number, email, and phone.
- **Faculty**: Stores faculty details including department constraint and unique fields.
- **Courses**: Stores course details and relates them to faculty.
- **Enrollments**: Manages student-course enrollments with grading and timestamps.

## 🚀 How to Use

2. Use a MySQL environment (like MySQL Workbench or an online SQL compiler).
3. Execute the scripts in order (`TASK1_...`, then `TASK2_...`, and so on).
4. Modify or extend queries for learning or practice.

## ✅ Skills Practiced

- Table design with constraints
- SQL INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE
